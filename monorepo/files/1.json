S3 \nS3 is a storage that offer a virtual storage for unlimited capacity\nIt have bucket and object\nBucket : It is a directory\nObject : It is a file inside a directory\n2. Lambda : Services that for handling deploying servicesSupport multiple language\n3. Dynamo DB :A database services Scalability\n4. Api gateway :\nMake for create, publish and maintain API.\nServe as an entry point for other services such as aws services\n\n***Pipeline : \n\n* Threat modeling :\n<i>Understand potential of threat\nDetect early\nEasy to understand visualy</i>\n\n* Question for Threating :\n<i>What are we working on\nWhat can go wrong\nWhat are we doing about this\nDid we do good job</i>\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                            Event-Driven Architectures\n.State and code are decouple\n.Integration via messages\n.Anync connection\n\nUsing for : \n.Decoupling the user experience and running code\n.Providing reduced latency on HTTP responses\n.Reducing the potential for timeouts or deadlocks\n\nEX :\n[Event source] ==&gt; [Lambda function] ==&gt; [Service]\n*Event source : Amazon SQS, Amazon SNS, Amazon Kinesis, api gateway\n*Service : Amazon DynamoDB\n\n*Amazon SQS* : Support standard and FIFO\n\nStandard : \n*/ Order is not guaranteed\n*/ Messages may be delivered more than once\n*/ Nearly unlimited messages per second\n\nFIFO : \n*/ Order is guaranteed per group ID\n*/ Messages are delivered only once. There are no duplicate messages introduced to the queue\n*/ FIFO queues support up to 300 messages per second, per API action without batching, or 3,000 with batching\n\nAmazon SQS integration with Lambda :\n[API GATEWAY] =&gt; [SQS Queue] =&gt; [Lambda services]\n\n[SQS queue pool] ==&gt; Lambda services (FIFO queue)\n| Size batch : 03 ( Ex ) | ==&gt; Lambda services process 3 batch\n* Success : =&gt; Response through the queue\n* Fail case : =&gt; Visible again in the queue pool for reprocess\n* Fail case retry reach : =&gt; Coming to Dead letter queue \n\n**Problems have to deal with lambda function**\n*/ Error and retry process\n*/ Must have rollback logic\n\n",
